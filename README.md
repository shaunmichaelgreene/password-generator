Welcome to the README for Shaun's Password Generator! 

**User Story:**
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

This app utilizes blends HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a simple 1-page app for the purpose of generating a random password based on user criteria inputs. Passwords can contain randomly selected lowercase, uppercase, numerical, and special characters. The user can stipulate the length of the password from 8 to 128 characters.
